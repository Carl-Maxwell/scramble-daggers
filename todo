better gameplay might be just having the player collect some items from treasure chests
and like dashing around or something

* there's an issue where as soon as you start the game the camera rotates straight up and 
then sticks in that orientation. possibly related to teh gymbal lock issues

* gimbal lock issue
  => maybe replace all references to .rotation with .quaternion
* walls blocking the game's edges
* maybe those walls blocking off the higher areas of the game
* a goal?
* bugs
  * A and D (strafing) are not working
* entities
  * enemies?
    * shooting at enemies?
    * enemies dying?
  * treasure chests?
* a menu
  * controlling the game seed
* instruct the user to use the keys
  * when they discover an enemy, instruct them in the ways of survival and victory
* sliding colissions
  * (realtime sliding collision restitution)
* have an end for the game, 
* juice
  * landing animation
  * 'head bobbing' style animation
  * screenshake!
  * explosions!
  * particles!
* maybe provide like a 'dash forward' command (right click or shift or something)

* there was a problem where the pointerlock code fired before the game stuff was created
  => not sure how to make it happen in the proper sequence
  => awkwardly the problem only happens once, unless you clear your cache (cause the files are all cached)

* when the browser is weirdly scaled the view is skewed looking (think like 1920*100)
