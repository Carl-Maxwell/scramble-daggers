better gameplay might be just having the player collect some items from treasure chests
and like dashing around or something

* walls blocking the game's edges
* maybe those walls blocking off the higher areas of the game
* maybe add minecraft like hills or something
* a goal?
* entities
* enemies?
* shooting at enemies?
* enemies dying?
* treasure chests?
* a menu
* controlling the game seed
* A and D (strafing) are not working
* instruct the user to use the keys
  * when they discover an enemy, instruct them in the ways of survival and victory
* sliding colissions
  * (realtime sliding collision restitution)
* have an end for the game, 
* landing animation
* 'head bobbing' style animation
* screenshake!
* maybe provide like a 'dash forward' command (right click or shift or something)
* explosions!
* particles!

* there was a problem where the pointerlock code fired before the game stuff was created
  => not sure how to make it happen in the proper sequence
  => awkwardly the problem only happens once, unless you clear your cache (cause the files are all cached)

* when the browser is weirdly scaled the view is skewed looking (think like 1920*100)
