=============

A minecraft-style javascript webgl game, built out of one of the *three.js* examples.

`testserver/` provides a server to use for testing the game locally, it requires nodejs (and a slew of nodejs modules)

to use it `cd testserver/` then run `nodejs bin-http-server.js ./../`

then you can access the game on http://localhost:8080

I copied the code for the server from https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server


## Attribution

This codebase was started from the minecraft AO demo for three js, and also
makes use of many js libraries (such as CanvasQuery and Seedrandom).
